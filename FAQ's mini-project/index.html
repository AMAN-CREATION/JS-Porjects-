        <h4>What is JavaScript ?</h4>

      <div class="answer">
        JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
        implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
        more than just sit there and display static information for you to look
        at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D
        graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.

        <h4>What is Promise in Javascript ?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach
        callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function. Imagine a
        function, createAudioFileAsync(), which asynchronously generates a sound
        file given a configuration record and two callback functions: one called
        if the audio file is successfully created, and the other called if an
        error occurs.

        <h4>What is Function in Javascript ?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A
        function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements
        that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to
        qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output
        where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the
        output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope
        from which you wish to call it.

        <h4>Introduction to the DOM.</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>

      <div class="answer">
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the
        objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the
        web. This guide will introduce the DOM, look at how the DOM represents
        an HTML document in memory and how to use APIs to create web content and
        applications.

        <h4>Introduction to Events.</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Events are things that happen in the system you are programming, which
        the system tells you about so your code can react to them.
